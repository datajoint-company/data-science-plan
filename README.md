# Data Science Plan 

This a template for the data science plan for a project or organization featuring a data pipeline.

## Definitions

Generally, a *data pipeline* is a collection of software tools, data storage and computing resources, procedures, and services for the entry, acquisition, ingest, processing, analysis, querying, navigation, and monitoring of shared data with provisions made for data integrity and efficiency.

# Project 
 
Define your project: what are its aims and expected outcomes.  

## Stakeholders
## Project timeline  
## Key personnel and their roles
Roles and responsibilities, contact persons.

## Allocated resources

# Data lifecycle
Define the role of the data pipeline in the project.

## Data modalities
Describe what data modalities will be included in the data science plan.

## Workflow
Describe the overall workflow in the project surrounding the data.

## Data entry
Define what data will need to be entered manually, when and how.

## Data acquisition
What data will be acquired directly from instrumentation?

## Data ingest and import
Define what data will need to be ingested from repositories and how.

## Preprocessing: raw and processed data
What types of initial processing will be performed on the data?  
Raw data are bulky data that do rarely need to be accessed after initial processing.
How often will the raw data  need to be accessed?   
Will preprocessing methods continue to evolve?

## Analysis
List general types of analyses that will need to be performed.
How extensively will the analysis method evolve during the experiment?

## Data sharing and publishing
What will the data be selected for publishing? 
How will external collaborators or public get access to the data? 

## Archival
What are the needs for data archival for long-term accessibility?
What data need to be archived? 
What interfaces should the 

# Collaboration 
Describe the needs for data exchange while the project is ongoing.
How will the team need to work jointly on the  data coming through the pipeline?

# Data security
Access control, encryption.

# Resources
IT resources dedicated to the project on premises and on the cloud.
IT support available.
